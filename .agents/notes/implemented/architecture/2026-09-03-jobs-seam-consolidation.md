# Agent Note: One output ring, one projection, one event stream for background jobs

Status: implemented

## Problem

The job seam had grown by accretion. Producers declared their output twice — a consuming `readOutput` hook the model read and an optional `record: true` ring observers read — and the registry kept two vocabularies for one job (`JobSnapshot` for the model, `SessionJob` on the session control stream, `JobWireChunk` on the observation wire). Three listener families (`onJobDone`, `onJobsChanged`, `onOutput`) delivered overlapping facts with different owner filters, and the registry itself tracked `reported`, a bit that only the model-facing tool could interpret. Review of the merged design called the interface layer the weakest part: a reader could not tell which of `read`, `readRecord`, `JobStart`, `RecordingJob`, and `updateDetail` was the contract and which was an accident of history.

## Decision

- **One ring per job.** `JobSpec` replaces `JobStart`: a spec names optional pull `output` sources (`JobOutputSource`, the subprocess `readFrom` family) that the registry pumps at its own cadence (`pumpPollMs` on `dsh-jobs-local`), and every producer receives a `JobHandle` whose `append` pushes chunks into the same ring. The model's consuming read and every observer's absolute-offset read serve the same bytes; `readOutput` and the `record` discriminator are gone. Shell producers hand the registry their `observed` offset readers and fold sandbox facts into the terminal `detail`; the terminal producer adapts its consuming send reader through a byte-counting source; the subagent returns its answer as `JobOutcome.result`, which the first read after settlement carries once.
- **Two cursors, one storage.** `VisibleJobs.read(id)` is the stateful model cursor; `VisibleJobs.readAt(id, from)` is the stateless observer read. Model reads exclude `log` chunks (producer narration for observers) and render stdout, then one `[stderr]` section, exactly as the shell tools always did.
- **`updateProgress` replaces `updateDetail`.** `JobView.progress` is the live line and is cleared at settlement; `JobView.detail` is the terminal reason, with the model's `job_kill` reason merged in.
- **One projection.** `JobView` (client-safe leaf `@deepseek-ai/dsh-jobs/view`) is what the model tools, the browser roster, and the observation frames consume; `owner` is the session id, never the `Agent`.
- **One caller-bound view.** `JobRegistry.visibleTo(caller?)` binds a session once and returns `list`, `get`, `read`, `readAt`, `kill`, and `wait`; every method throws for an id outside the caller's set without distinguishing unknown from foreign.
- **One event stream.** `events.subscribe(filter, listener)` with `{ owner }`, `{ owners: 'scope' }`, or `{ owners: 'all' }` replaces the three listener families. `settled` names its cause (`producer`, `kill`, `teardown`); `output` carries only the id and the new total.
- **The notice ledger moves to `dsh-tool-jobs`.** The registry no longer tracks `reported`. The tool claims a job when a wait starts (and withdraws on timeout or abort) and when `job_kill` is accepted; the settlement event drops the entry, teardown settlements and unowned jobs are skipped, and the destination is the agent registered for the owner session at settlement.
- **The roster leaves the session control stream.** `dsh-api-job-controller` owns `job.rows({ sessionId })` — whole-set frames after each coalesced burst of lifecycle commits, never per append — beside `job.observe`, and its client installs `ctx.jobs` (`watchRows`, `observe`, one snapshot). `dsh-api-session-controller` carries queues and projections only; `ui-jobs` watches its session's roster while mounted, and a row is expandable while live or once it left retained output behind.

`attachController` and the owner-relative `servesOwner` gate stay as they were; whether a producer may offer `run_in_background` without a mounted controller is deferred, since the gap predates this change.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep three listeners with a shared owner filter.** It preserves the accreted names but not the property reviewers asked for — one place to learn what the registry announces — and `onJobDone`'s exact-owner delivery is what forced the registry to keep an `Agent` in every projection.
- **Keep `reported` in the registry.** Only the tool knows which deliveries reach the model (a wait's tool result, a kill's acknowledgement); the registry could only approximate it, and the approximation was the source of the double-notice and missed-notice bugs the review listed.
- **Keep the roster on the session control stream.** It saved one Remote stream but coupled the session controller to the job registry and mirrored a `record` flag the ring's byte count now answers directly (`output.total`).
- **Serve `log` chunks to the model too.** Producer narration is for observers; the model already receives the same facts through `progress` and the terminal `detail`.

## Consequences

The model-visible text is unchanged: status lines, tool descriptions and schemas, and notice wording are byte-identical, and the only new model-visible fact is the kill reason a `killed` status line now carries. A producer that needs to stream output picks pull sources or `append`; it never formats a consuming delta. The Web client renders every live job as expandable, so a job that never writes shows an empty running panel instead of a static row. `JobKindMap` merges are host-side, so a browser program types `JobView.kind` as the kinds it knows and treats the rest as opaque strings, which is all the roster does with it.

Review follow-ups after the master merge tightened four of these edges. A job's first event is always `registered`: the announcement precedes the pump, whose first drain runs synchronously and may announce output. A settled ring keeps every byte the model cursor has not consumed until the first terminal model read, so a job that finishes before its first `job_output` loses nothing the live cap retained. `dsh-tool-jobs` counts wait claims per call, so a timed-out wait withdraws only its own claim while a concurrent wait keeps the settlement covered. The browser records an observation failure that precedes the anchor as an errored view, so the panel shows the notice instead of staying blank. The `@deepseek-ai/dsh-jobs/invariant` companion checks the announced event protocol per job (registered first, one settlement, removal last) and each announced projection against the registry's own read, which is the cross-observation the [companion rule](../simplification/2026-08-28-omit-unneeded-invariant-companions.md) requires; the earlier single-view field checks are gone.
