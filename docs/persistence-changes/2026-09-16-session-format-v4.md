## Compatibility

The tool-role declaration changes ten event roots because inbox entries, message events, compaction summaries, title requests, team messages, and PTC dispatches embed the shared `Message` or `ContentBlock` declarations. Removing `tool-result` from that union and specializing message roles changes those reachable schemas without adding ten independent event protocols. The `turn/end` change separately records the forked reason; `SessionHeader` records the version increase.

The [native V4 validation decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-17-native-v4-read-validation.md) owns the reader admission required by these current fields.

The V3-to-V4 migration lifts released user-role tool results into tool-role messages with a required toolCallId and optional isError. Tool-result wrappers leave the content-block union. The migration preserves every admitted source event and inherited cut, and appends missing parent subagent/catalog records from retained direct-child logs in the same persistence root. Historical body restoration requires an explicit child-evidence set, including an empty set when no children are available to backfill. Missing required descriptors or conflicting identities refuse migration without publication; existing catalog facts remain. Historical read opens prepare the result in memory. Write opens revalidate child membership and revisions before publishing the current successor beside unchanged predecessor files. Delivery-generation checks keep historical acknowledgements from becoming active V4 watermarks. V3 readers refuse the newer generation. The same unreleased transition adds forked to turn/end.reason; exact-cut forks append child-owned error results and closers after the inherited marker. V4 admits checked not-started fork results with deterministic branch-specific IDs and wording; released V0–V3 validators and recorded predecessor generations remain unchanged.

The `request/header` schema also records the retired `system` key as forbidden. This declaration captures the existing native-reader refusal without changing stored data or prompt reconstruction; later permitting a value requires a version bump instead of being classified as an ordinary optional-field addition.

Producer-owned sources replace released plugin wrappers through the [V3-to-V4 migration](../../packages/session/session-format-v3-to-v4/README.md#v3-to-v4-specification). The frozen rename table and collision rules preserve source fields and event coordinates; unknown producer attribution retains every own JSON property. Native read and write opens validate source fields before exposing the Session. Existing V4 files do not rerun the incoming migration edge.

The core-owned user source property records the attribution-preservation policy; tmux-context qualifies its location attribution while retaining producer-local duplicate suppression. Auto Review and the compaction summarizer use request-only user inputs, removing their active source registrations without removing historical migration support. These inputs cannot be written as durable Session messages. Catalog formatVersion 2 stores the policy metadata; it does not change the Session version or rewrite frozen schema records. System, model, and tool sources retain their strict semantic rules.

## Verification

The focused Session, agent-loop, Session Controller, V4, chat-view, and compaction suites passed 1,523 tests across 63 files after integration of exact-cut forks. V4 fork tests retain original IDs and text across encoding, decoding, and restoration, reject malformed results, and validate nested inherited cuts. The tool-role migration tests and SDK snapshot refresh also passed in the originating change; the built Python runtime sdk-snapshot scenario passed, and focused pi-ai and auto-review coverage passed 351 tests with 100% coverage of the three affected modules.

The generated request-header reservation regression and existing retired-syntax and Session surface tests pass 65 tests across three files. The generated field retains optional `never`; permitting an optional string produces a version-bump diagnostic while the native reader still refuses the retired key.

The producer-source and request-input checks pass 447 tests across 12 files, including provider equality, request-only type rejection, user-attribution retention, source migration, and native source admission. Comparing the generated inventories with the tool-role parent reports four changed roots and 447 unchanged type fingerprints.
