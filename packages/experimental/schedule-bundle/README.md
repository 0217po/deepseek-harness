# @deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-schedule-bundle

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This optional bundle switches on the three Schedule rows that `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app` inserts with `disabled: true`: `time-context`, `schedule`, and `ui-schedule`. Its patch appends no row and declares no plugin dependency, so enabling it cannot mount a Host service twice. Shipped profiles leave it switched off.

## Use this package

Open Plugins in the Web sidebar and enable Scheduling and time context, marked by a clock icon. A live root Agent then receives `schedule_create`, `schedule_list`, `schedule_update`, and `schedule_delete`, the Session header shows its reminder catalog, the right sidebar shows the Automation tasks page, and each eligible step appends one clock reading with the current time, the browser zone attached to the open request, and the elapsed time since the preceding model-visible message. Disabling the bundle restores the shipped composition; stored tasks remain on disk.

<summary>Maintainer details — click to expand</summary>

`cordis.patch.yml` carries three id-targeted patches, each setting `disabled: false` on a row the Web bundle already inserts. `OPTIONAL_BUNDLES` in `packages/boot/app-boot/src/profile.ts` names this package and `apps/cli` depends on it, so every installation ships it switched off and the plugin manager offers it in the Official group. Selecting it appends the bundle to the profile's `dsh.profile.bundles` list, and the profile launcher applies the bundle layers after the Web layer. No runtime invariant companion is published, because this configuration-only package owns no mutable runtime state.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml) | Three `disabled: false` patches over the shipped Web rows |
| [`locale/en.json`](locale/en.json), [`locale/zh.json`](locale/zh.json) | Plugin-manager title and description |
| [`icon.svg`](icon.svg) | Plugin-manager icon |
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | Empty module entry; the patch is the runtime content |

## Further Exploration

- [Schedule subsystem](../../../docs/subsystems/schedule.md) — durable tasks, occurrence resolution, and delivery.
- [Schedule service](../../schedule/schedule/README.md) — Host task storage, activation, and the record format.
- [Web bundle](../../bundle/web-app/README.md) — the composition that carries these rows.

## Model Experience

### Reminder tools and clock readings

#### What the model sees

A live root Agent gains `schedule_create`, `schedule_list`, `schedule_update`, and `schedule_delete`. `time-context` appends one durable user message per eligible step carrying the sampled instant, the browser zone attached to the open request, and the elapsed time since the preceding model-visible message.

#### Token effect

Selecting the bundle adds four Schedule tool schemas to every live root Agent request and one durable clock reading per eligible step; a conversation that never creates a reminder pays both.

#### KV Cache effect

The tool schemas change the request prefix once when the bundle mounts; each appended reading is new visible content after that prefix, so existing entries are not invalidated.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- The switch targets rows `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app` inserts. A profile without that bundle carries no such rows, so this bundle changes nothing there.
- Selecting the bundle adds the four Schedule tool schemas to every live root Agent and one clock reading per eligible step. A conversation that never creates a reminder still pays both costs.
